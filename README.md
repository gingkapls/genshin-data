- Historical and future banner and related data in JSON format
- Character and Weapon lists are updated automatically, while banner data is updated by hand because I haven't found a list with banner durations down to the minute.


## Running it locally
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- Run `node run populate` to update /data
- Mnually update /data/banners.json because nothing in life is perfect
